    <p id = 'title'>About me</p>
    <p class = 'subtitle'>Hi everyone! <br><br> My name is Micaiah Cape. Let's just say - I never liked origami! I would remember walking into afternoon classes and dreading the fact that we were going to do origami that day. It did not make any sense to me. <br><br> Weird, right? What made me so attracted to origami to the point that I coded a website for it? Well, that's where the rest of the story comes in. <br><br> Due to some family problems, I found myself living in a foreign country at just 11 years old. Then, I realized I couldn't hang out with friends at all due to the language barrier. Therefore, I started to keep to myself and actually try origami. I was desparate for something to do and needed a creative outlet - as a result I took a sheet of paper and started to fold it in any way possible, trying to create <i>anything.</i> I vaguely remember what my first model looked like. </p>
    <p class = 'subtitle'>As simple as this model was (two folds to the center line and a pleat fold at one end), this immediately inspired me. I noticed that it looked like a futuristic vehicle, like the ones in <i>Star Wars.</i> This one in particular looked slightly like the Landspeeder with its side engines cut off, giving it the impression that it could hover above ground at extremely high speeds. This was where my interest really shot up. There was an origami book at home that showed me how to fold basic models, and little by little I started to learn about the different folds and bases. I was able to successfully create the <i>Millenium Falcon</i>, the <i>TIE Fighter</i>, and the <i>X-wing Starfighter.</i> using my own instructions. Unfortunately, I can't share the my instructions to these models due to possible copyright infringement.</p>
    <p class = 'subtitle'>My models started to become better and I started to think outside the box for some futuristic-looking vehicles. That was when "Air Zoomer" (Future Vehicle 1) came in. This was an instant success and was the first model I've ever written instructions for - all models before that I just relied on memory. Ever since then I started to write instructions by hand. As more new models came, things started to go well but quickly became a disaster. From messed up scale to smudges to huge mistakes, the sketches weren't visually appealing at all, and it seemed like I could only understand them.</p>
    <p class = 'subtitle'>That's when I decided to make instructions online, using a graphics editor (Inkscape). Most of my models and their instructions could now be found on this site!</p>
